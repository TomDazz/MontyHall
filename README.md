Monty Hall problem (few bugs)

This website was created with the help of chatGPT to help solve bugs and problems with my code. 

I started this project over the summer when I found out about the Monty Hall problem and thought it would be an interesting project to code.

There remain a few bugs in this project which I intend to fix at a later date.

Bugs include:
1. (if door 2 is selected as the first choice it will show up as switched if you stay with that door on the second turn)
  for this reason, I would recommend selecting the first door for your first choice to make sure the results are accurate.

2. (the website doesn't work well on strange resolutions)
  As long as you are using a desktop computer to run the website everything should work accordingly.
